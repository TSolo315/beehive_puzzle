            <li>The goal is to repopulate the hive in as few turns as possible and by placing as few bees as possible.</li>
            <li>You can place a bee on the board by clicking on a hexagonal tile.</li>
            <li>A tile that is surrounded by three bee tiles will be converted into a bee tile.</li>
            <li>When you click simulate tiles will be converted in turns until either no tiles are converted or the entire hive has been repopulated.</li>
